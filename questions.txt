Questions

1. What were some of the challenges you encountered?
    - During the tutorial I accidently cloned the finished product at the top of the page instead of the starter code. 
      After switching codebases in the same repository, I had issues running npm start.
        - Fixed by deleting repository and starting a new one and re-running npm install

    - Ran into an error "useState" is not defined
        - Resolved by changing "import { useState } from 'react';" to "import React, { useEffect, useState } from "react";" in App.js


2. Differentiate between Real DOM and Virtual DOM. List out a few differences.
