Questions

1. What were some of the challenges you encountered?
  - During the tutorial I accidently cloned the finished product at the top of the page instead of the starter code. 
    After switching codebases in the same repository, I had issues running npm start.
      - Fixed by deleting repository and starting a new one and re-running npm install

  - Ran into an error "useState" is not defined
      - Resolved by changing "import { useState } from 'react';" to "import React, { useEffect, useState } from "react";" in App.js


2. Differentiate between Real DOM and Virtual DOM. List out a few differences.

  - The virtual dom is what react uses to render content for the real dom. Much like a blueprint for how the real dom would work.
    - The virtual dom increases performance by limiting 


3. What are some problems that React can solve for us?
  - Solves performance issues
  - Allows for easier modularity
  - Allows for easier bug fixing and further expandibility
